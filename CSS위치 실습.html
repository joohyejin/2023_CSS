        Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply 
        random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin 
        literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. 
        Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney 
        College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure 
        Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, 
        and going through the cites of the word in classical 
        literature, discovered the undoubtable source. 
        Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of 
        "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) 
        by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the 
        theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. 
        The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..
        ", comes from a line in section 1.10.32."But I must explain 
        to you how all this mistaken idea of denouncing pleasure and 
        praising pain was born and I will give you a complete account 
        of the system, and expound the actual teachings of the great 
        explorer of the truth, the master-builder of human happiness. 
        No one rejects, dislikes, or avoids pleasure itself, because 
        it is pleasure, but because those who do not know how to pursue
        pleasure rationally encounter consequences that are extremely painful. 
        Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to 
        obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because 
        occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can 
        procure him some great pleasure. To take a trivial example, 
        which of us ever undertakes laborious physical exercise, 
        except to obtain some advantage from it? But who has any 
        right to find fault with a man who chooses to enjoy a pleasure 
        that has no annoying consequences, or one who avoids a pain 
        that produces no resultant pleasure?"
